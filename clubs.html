            <h1>GOLF CLUB</h1>
            <p>This is one of the newest clubs to be introduced in the school. The club has 
                enabled us to go to a number of golf clubs such as Muthaiga and Karen golf clubs.</p>
            <p>All this has been able to happen because of the old boys association which has donated 
                some money to finance some of our equipment.  Furthermore in the upcoming year we intend to 
                hold tournaments with schools such as Oshwal and Braeburn. 
                We hope to seek a lot of support to enhance our training and generally the support and become rather better in golf.</p>
